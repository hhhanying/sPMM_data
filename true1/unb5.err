[WARN  tini (7)] Tini is not running as PID 1 .
Zombie processes will not be re-parented to Tini, so zombie reaping won't work.
To fix the problem, run Tini as PID 1.

Sampling 2 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (2_000 + 2_000 draws total) took 2195 seconds.
The chain contains only diverging samples. The model is probably misspecified.
The chain contains only diverging samples. The model is probably misspecified.
The acceptance probability does not match the target. It is 0.6796733785721437, but should be close to 0.8. Try to increase the number of tuning steps.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.4 for some parameters. The sampler did not converge.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
